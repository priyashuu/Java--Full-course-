### Explanation:

1. **`class FirstClass {`**  
   - This line defines a class named `FirstClass`. In Java, all code must be contained within a class. The class name should be capitalized according to Java naming conventions.

2. **`public static void main(String[] args) {`**  
   - This line defines the `main` method, which is the entry point of any Java application. When the program is run, the `main` method is the first method that gets called.
   - **`public`**: This is an access modifier that allows the method to be accessible from anywhere.
   - **`static`**: This means the method belongs to the class, not instances of it. It can be called without creating an object of the class.
   - **`void`**: This indicates that the method does not return any value.
   - **`String[] args`**: This is an array of `String` objects. It stores any command-line arguments passed to the program when it is executed.

3. **`System.out.println("Hey");`**  
   - This line prints the string `"Hey"` to the console, followed by a newline. 
   - **`System.out`**: This is an output stream used to print data to the console.
   - **`println`**: This is a method that prints the argument passed to it and then terminates the line (moves to the next line in the console).
